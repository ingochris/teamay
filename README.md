## Inspiration
The internet can be very distracting. 
When researching new information or referencing sources, opening new tabs and jumping between websites is a big time-waster and distracts us from our main focus.

## What it does
Juni is an AI-enhanced Text-Editor that allows us to perform our research in an easy and streamlined form without the need to jump around different websites.

## How we built it
Juni is built on NodeJS and is powered by a variety of API sources, such as Google, Merriam-Webster, and Wolfram - Alpha. 

## Challenges we ran into
Keyword regex programming was a tricky hurdle to conquer.

## Accomplishments
We are proud of how efficient Juni has made internet-enhanced writing.

## What's next for Juni
Package Juni with embed plugin capability for web-wide adoption.
